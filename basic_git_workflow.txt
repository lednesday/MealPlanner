Starting a repo (Mealplanner, we have already done this!)
=================
Create a repo
Add other people as collaborators


To make a change
==================
* make a feature (or whatever) branch
	git checkout -b branchname
	# push to your branch
	git push --set-upstream origin feature1

* make changes on feature branch
	change, commit, push

* make pull request
	github > pull requests
	set branch to pull from back to master
	describe changes in puill request
	optionally: assign people to give a review

* review pull request
	go to "files changed" tab, and click the plus sign next to code you want to comment,
	or else start a review by clicking 'review changes'
	then "finish review" saying whether your review is neutral (comment) approve, or requests changes

* merge pull request
	now the master branch will have whatever changes are made on the feature branch

* merge master into other branches that are now behind
	checkout master branch and pull to make sure you have the most recent commits
	checkout feature branch again
	git merge master

* resolving merge conflicts
	find conflicts that start and end with <<<<<< >>>>>>>
	make a version that doesn't have them -- ie. resolves the conflict
	commit, push


Using Issues
==============

Structured way to tell your collaborators that you want something changed, a bug fixed, etc.
- write down proposals as enhancements and assign to relevant people
- raise bugs, complaints, etc.
- make clear the distribution of labor

Moving around in history
=========================

checkout n-back
git checkout HEAD~1
